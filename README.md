# Mera Portfolio (Starter)

Simple, responsive starter website with Home, Projects, About, and Contact sections.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step needed.

## Customize

- In `index.html`:
  - Replace `[आपका नाम]` with your name.
  - Update Projects (titles, descriptions, links, and images).
  - In the contact form handler (in `script.js`), change `you@example.com` to your email.
- In `styles.css`:
  - Tweak colors in the `:root` tokens.
  - Adjust layouts under the Responsive section.

## Notes

- The contact form opens your default email app using `mailto:`. For a real backend, connect an API like Formspree or build a server.
